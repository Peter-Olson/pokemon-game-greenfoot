# pokemon-game-greenfoot

A recreation of Pokemon battles with sprites, sounds, items, attacks, a Pokedex, and more

The Pokemon battle is initiated when two Pokemon actors collide in the PokemonArena. An example Pikachu.java class shows what properties of the Pokemon can be specified through the constructor. Note that there are limitations on the Pokemon, which are moderated by OfficerJenny.java.
